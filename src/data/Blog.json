Handwoven fabrics like Banarasi, Chanderi, and Tussar silk are making a strong comeback, with a focus on sustainability and artisanal craftsmanship.\n\nPastel shades such as lavender, blush pink, mint green, and ivory are dominating wardrobes, while bold jewel tones like emerald and ruby are perfect for festive occasions. Minimalist borders, delicate zari work, and floral motifs inspired by nature are trending this year.\n\nDraping styles have also evolved — pre-stitched sarees, belted pallus, and layered drapes are popular among young women who want comfort without compromising style.\n\nAccessorize with handcrafted jewelry, potli bags, and classic juttis to complete your look."
